When run, the program requires a directory path as a Command Line argument in order to proceed its execution.
The path can be either relative or absolute.

The project itself provides some text files (books) from the GutenBerg project in the "local/folder" directory.

You can pass the "path" argument as in the example below if you would like to test the program with the provided files.
Example: args[0] = "src/local/folder"

If you would like to test it with another preferred folder you can also pass absolute paths such as:
"C:\Users\tedie\Desktop\GutenBerg Books"
