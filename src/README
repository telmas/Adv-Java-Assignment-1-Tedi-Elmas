The project itself provides some text files (books) from the GutenBerg project in the "local/folder" directory.

You can pass the "path" argument as in the example below if you would like to test the program with the provided files.
Example: args[0] = "src/local/folder"

If you would like to test it with another preferred folder you can also pass absolute paths such as:
"C:\Users\tedie\Desktop\GutenBerg Books"

Make sure to pass them as String values with the double quotation marks: ""
