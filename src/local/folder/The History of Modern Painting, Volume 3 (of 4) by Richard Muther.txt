CHAPTER XXVIII

REALISM IN ENGLAND


The year 1849 was made famous by a momentous interruption in the quiet
course of English art brought about by the pre-Raphaelites. A movement,
recalling the Renaissance, laid hold of the spirit of painters. In all
studios artists spoke a language which had never been heard there
before; all great reputations were overthrown; the most celebrated
Cinquecentisti, whose names had hitherto been mentioned with respectful
awe, were referred to with a shrug as bunglers. A miracle seemed to have
taken place in the world, for the muse of painting was removed from the
pedestal on which she had stood for three centuries and set up in
triumph upon another.

To understand fully the aims of pre-Raphaelitism it is necessary to
recall the character of the age which gave it birth.

After English art had had its beginning with the great national masters
and enjoyed a prime of real splendour, it became, about the middle of
the nineteenth century, the prey to a tedious disease. A series of crude
historical painters endeavoured to fathom the noble style of the Italian
Cinquecento, without rising above the level of intelligent plagiarism.
As brilliant decorative artists possessed of pomp and majesty, and
sensuously affected by plastic beauty, as worshippers of the nude human
form, and as modern Greeks, the Italian classic painters were the worst
conceivable guides for a people who in every artistic achievement have
pursued spiritual expression in preference to plastic beauty. But in
spite of the experiences gained since the time of Hogarth, they all went
on the pilgrimage to Rome, as to a sacred spring, drank their fill in
long draughts, and came back poisoned. Even Wilkie, that charming
"little master," who did the work of a pioneer so long as he followed
the congenial Flemish painters and the Dutch, even Wilkie lost every
trace of individuality after seeing Spain and Italy. As this imitation
of the high Renaissance period led to forced and affected sentiment, it
also developed an empty academical technique. In accordance with the
precepts of the Cinquecento, artists proceeded with an affected ease to
make brief work of everything, contenting themselves with a superficial
_façade_ effect. A painting based on dexterity of hand took the place of
the religious study of nature, and a banal arrangement after celebrated
models took the place of inward absorption.

It was to no purpose that certain painters, such as _F. C. Horsley_, _J.
R. Herbert_, _J. Tenniel_, _Edwin Long_, _E. M. Ward_, and _Eastlake_,
the English Piloty, by imitation of the Flemish and Venetian masters,
made more of a return from idealism of form to colour, and that _Edwin
Armitage_, who had studied in Paris and Munich, introduced Continental
influences. They are the Delaroche, Gallait, and Bièfve of England.
Their art was an imposing scene painting, their programme always that of
the school of Bologna--the mother of all academies, great and
small--borrowing drawing from Michael Angelo and colour from Titian;
taking the best from every one, putting it all into a pot, and shaking
it together. Thus English art lost the peculiar national stamp which it
had had under Reynolds and Gainsborough, Constable and Turner. It became
an insignificant tributary of the false art which then held sway over
the Continent, insincere towards nature, full of empty rhetorical
passion, and bound to the most vacant routine. And as the grand painting
became hollow and mannered, _genre_ painting grew Philistine and
decrepit. Its innocent childishness and conventional optimism had led to
a tedious anecdotic painting. It repeated, like a talkative old man, the
most insipid tales, and did so with a complacency that never wavered and
with an unpleasant motley of colour. The English school still existed in
landscape, but for everything else it was dead.

A need for reform became urgent all the sooner because literature too
had diverged into new lines. In poetry there was the influence of the
Lake poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, who had simplicity, direct feeling
for nature, and a Rousseau-like pantheism inscribed as a device upon
their banner, and it came as a reaction against the dazzling imaginative
fervour of those great and forceful men of genius Byron and Shelley.
Keats had again uttered the phrase which had before been Shaftesbury's
gospel: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." In the year 1843 John Ruskin
published the first volume of his _Modern Painters_, the æsthetic creed
of which culminated in the tenet that nature alone could be the source
of all true art.

This transitional spirit, which strove for liberty from the academical
yoke, though diffidently at first, is represented in painting by the
Scotch artist _William Dyce_. In England he pursued, though undoubtedly
with greater ability, a course parallel to that of the German Nazarenes,
whose faith he championed. Born in 1806, he had in Italy, in the year
1826, made the acquaintance of Overbeck, who won him over to Perugino
and Raphael. Protesting against the histrionic emptiness of English
historical painting, he took refuge with the Quattrocentisti and the
young Raphael. His masterpiece, the Westminster frescoes, with the
Arthurian legends as their subject, goes to some extent on parallel
lines with Schnorr's frescoes on the Nibelungen myths. The
representation of vigorous manhood and tempestuous heroism has been here
attempted without sentimentality or theatrical heroics. In his oil
pictures--Madonnas, "Bacchus nursed by the Nymphs," "The Woman of
Samaria," "Christ in Gethsemane," "St. John leading Home the Virgin,"
etc.--he makes a surprising effect by the graceful, sensuous charm of
his women, by his exquisite landscapes and his tender idyllic
characters. The charming work "Jacob and Rachel," which represents
him in the Hamburg Kunsthalle, might be ascribed to Führich, except that
the developed feeling for colour bears witness to its English origin.
With yearning the youth hastens to the maiden, who stands, leaning
against the edge of the well, with her eyes cast down, half repulsing
him in her austere chastity.

  DYCE.   JACOB AND RACHEL.]

Where the Nazarenes obtain a pallid, corpse-like effect, a deep and
luminous quality of colour delights one in his pictures. He is
essentially graceful, and with this grace he combines the pure and quiet
simplicity of the Umbrian masters. There is something touching in
certain of his Madonnas, who, in long, clinging raiment, appeal to the
Godhead with arms half lifted, devout lips parted in prayer, and mild
glances lost in infinity. A dreamy loveliness brings the heavenly
figures nearer to us. Dyce expresses the magic of downcast lids with
long, dark lashes. Like the Umbrians, he delights in the elasticity of
slender limbs and the chaste grace of blossoming maiden beauty. Many
German fresco painters have become celebrated who never achieved
anything equal in artistic merit to the Westminster pictures of Dyce.
Yet he is to be reckoned with the Flandrin-Overbeck family, since he
gives a repetition of the young Raphael, though he certainly does it
well; but he only imitates and has not improved upon him.

The pictures of another Scotchman, _Sir Joseph Noël Paton_, born in
1821, appear at a rather later date. Most of them--"The Quarrel of
Oberon and Titania," "The Reconciliation of Oberon and Titania" in the
Edinburgh Gallery, and his masterpiece, "The Fairy Queen"--have, from
the æsthetic standpoint, little enjoyment to offer. The drawing is hard,
the composition overladen, the colour scattered and motley. As in Ary
Scheffer, all the figures have vapid, widely opened eyes. Elves, gnomes,
women, knights, and fantastic rocks are crowded so tightly together that
the frame scarcely holds them. But the loving study of nature in the
separate parts is extraordinary. It is possible to give a botanical
definition of each plant and each flower in the foreground, with so much
character and such care has Paton executed every leaf and every blossom,
even the tiny creeping things amid the meadow grass. Here and there a
fresh ray of morning sun breaks through the light green and leaps from
blade to blade. The landscapes of Albrecht Altdorfer are recalled to
mind. Emancipation from empty, heroically impassioned emphasis,
pantheistic adoration of nature, even a certain effort--unsuccessful
indeed--after an independent sentiment for colour, are what his pictures
seem to preach in their naïve angularity, their loving execution of
detail, and their bright green motley.

This was the mood of the young artists who united to form the
pre-Raphaelite group of 1848. They were students at the Royal Academy of
from twenty to four-and-twenty years of age. The first of the group,
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, had already written some of his poems. The
second, Holman Hunt, had still a difficulty in overcoming the opposition
of his father, who was not pleased to see him giving up a commercial
career. John Everett Millais, the youngest, had made most progress as a
painter, and was one of the best pupils at the Academy. But they were
contented neither by the artistic achievement of their teachers nor by
the method of instruction. Etty, the most valued of them all, according
to the account of Holman Hunt, painted mythological pictures, full of
empty affectation; Mulready drew in a diluted fashion, and sacrificed
everything to elegance; Maclise had fallen into patriotic banalities;
Dyce had stopped short in his course and begun again when it was too
late. Thus they had of necessity to provide their own training for
themselves. All three worked in the same studio; and it so happened that
one day--in 1847 or 1848--chance threw into their hands some engravings
of Benozzo Gozzoli's Campo-Santo frescoes in Pisa. Nature and
truth--everything which they had dimly surmised, and had missed in the
productions of English art--here they were. Overcome with admiration for
the sparkling life, the intensity of feeling, and the vigorous form of
these works, which did not even shrink from the consequences of
ugliness, they were agreed in recognising that art had always stood on
the basis of nature until the end of the fifteenth century, or, more
exactly, until the year 1508, when Raphael left Florence to paint in the
Vatican in Rome. Since then everything had gone wrong; art had stripped
off the simple garment of natural truthfulness and fallen into
conventional phrases, which in the course of centuries had become more
and more empty and repellent by vapid repetition. Was it necessary that
the persons in pictures should, to the end of the world, stand and move
just as they had done a thousand times in the works of the
Cinquecentisti? Was it necessary that human emotions--love, boldness,
remorse, and renunciation--should always be expressed by the same turn
of the head, the same lift of the eyebrows, the same gesture of the
arms, and the same folded hands, which came into vogue through the
Cinquecentisti? Where in nature are the rounded forms which Raphael, the
first Classicist, borrowed from the antique? And in the critical moments
of life do people really form themselves into such carefully balanced
groups, with the one who chances to have on the finest clothes in the
centre?

[Illustration: _Annan, photo._

  PATON.   THE RECONCILIATION OF OBERON AND TITANIA.]

From this reaction against the Cinquecentisti and against the shallow
imitation of them, the title pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and the secret,
masonic sign P.R.B., which they added to their signatures upon their
pictures, are rendered comprehensible. But whilst Dyce, to avoid the
Cinquecentisti, imitated the Quattrocentisti, the title here is only
meant to signify that these artists, like the Quattrocentisti, had
determined to go back to the original source of real life. The Academy
pupils Rossetti, Millais, and Holman Hunt, together with the young
sculptor Thomas Woolner, who had just left school, were at first the
only members of the Brotherhood. Later the _genre_ painter James
Collinson, the painter and critic F. G. Stephens, and Rossetti's
brother, William Michael Rossetti, were admitted to the alliance.

Boldly they declared war against all conventional rules, described
themselves as beginners and their pictures as attempts, and announced
themselves to be, at any rate, sincere. The programme of their school
was truth; not imitation of the old masters, but strict and keen study
of nature such as the old masters had practised themselves. They were in
reaction against the superficial dexterity of technique and the beauty
of form and intellectual emptiness to which the English historical
picture had fallen victim; they were in reaction against the trivial
banality which disfigured English _genre_ painting. In the
representation of passion the true gestures of nature were to be
rendered, without regard to grace and elegance, and without the stock
properties of pantomime. The end for which they strove was to be true
and not to create what was essentially untrue by a borrowed idealism
which had an appearance of being sublime. In opposition to the negligent
painting of the artists of their age, they demanded slavishly faithful
imitation of the model by detail, carried out with microscopic
exactness. Nothing was to be done without reverence for nature; every
part of a picture down to the smallest blade or leaf was to be directly
painted from the original. Even at the expense of total effect every
picture was to be carried out in minutest detail. It was better to
stammer than to make empty phrases. A young and vigorous art, such as
had been in the fifteenth century, could win its way, as they believed,
from this conception alone.

In all these points, in the revolt against the emptiness of the _beauté
suprême_ and the flowing lines of the accepted routine of composition,
they were at one with Courbet and Millet. It was only in further
developments that the French and English parted company; English realism
received a specifically English tinge. Since every form of
Classicism--for to this point they were led by the train of their
ideas--declares the ideal completion of form, of physical presentment,
to be its highest aim, the standard-bearers of realism were obliged to
seek the highest aim of their art, founded exclusively on the study of
nature, in the representation of moral and intellectual life, in a
thoughtful form of spiritual creation. The blending of realism with
profundity of ideas, of uncompromising truth to nature in form with
philosophic and poetic substance, is of the very essence of the
pre-Raphaelites. They are transcendental naturalists, equally widely
removed from Classicism, which deals only with beautiful bodies, as from
realism proper, which only proposes to represent a fragment of nature.
From opposition to abstract beauty of form they insist upon what is
characteristic, energetic, angular; but their figures painted faithfully
from nature are the vehicles of a metaphysical idea. From the first they
saturated themselves with poetry. Holman Hunt has an enthusiasm for
Keats and the Bible, Rossetti for Dante, Millais for the mediæval poems
of chivalry.

All three appeared before the public for the first time in the year
1849. John Millais and Holman Hunt exhibited in the Royal Academy, the
one being represented by his "Lorenzo and Isabella," a subject drawn
from Keats, the other by his "Rienzi." Rossetti had his picture, "The
Girlhood of Mary Virgin," exhibited at the Free Exhibition, afterwards
known as the Portland Gallery. All three works excited attention and
also derision, and much shaking of heads. The three next works of
1850--"A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary," by
Holman Hunt; "The Child Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the Carpenter,"
by Millais; and "The Annunciation" by Rossetti--were received with the
same amused contempt. When they exhibited for the third time--Holman
Hunt, a scene from _The Two Gentlemen of Verona_; Millais, "The Return
of the Dove to the Ark" and "The Woodman's Daughter"--such a storm of
excitement broke forth that the pictures had to be removed from the
exhibition. A furious article appeared in _The Art Journal_; the
exhibitors, it was said, were certainly young, but they were too old to
commit such sins of youth. Even Dickens turned against them in
_Household Words_. The painters who had been assailed made their answer.
William Michael Rossetti laid down the principles of the Brotherhood by
an article in a periodical called _The Critic_, and smuggled a second
article into _The Spectator_. In 1850 they founded a monthly magazine
for the defence of their theories, _The Germ_, which on the third number
took the title _Art and Poetry_, and was most charmingly embellished
with drawings by Holman Hunt, Madox Brown, and others. Stephens
published an essay in it, on the ways and aims of the early Italians,
which gave him occasion to discuss the works recently produced in the
spirit of simplicity known to these old masters. Madox Brown wrote a
paper on historical painting, in which he asserted that the true basis
of historical painting must be strict fidelity to the model, to the
exclusion of all generalisation and beautifying, and exact antiquarian
study of costumes and furniture in contradistinction to the fancy
history of the elder painters. But all these articles were written to no
purpose. After the fourth number the magazine was stopped, and in these
days it has become a curiosity for bibliomaniacs. But support came from
another side. Holman Hunt's picture dealing with a scene from
Shakespeare's _Two Gentlemen of Verona_ received the most trenchant
condemnation in _The Times_. John Ruskin came forward as his champion
and replied on 13th May 1851. _The Times_ contained yet a second letter
from him on 30th May. And soon afterwards both were issued as a
pamphlet, with the title _Pre-Raphaelitism_, _its Principles, and
Turner_. These works, he said, did not imitate old pictures, but nature;
what alienated the public in them was their truth and rightness, which
had broken abruptly and successfully with the conventional sweep of
lines.

  (_By permission of Albert Wood, Esq., the owner of the picture._)]

_Holman Hunt_ is the painter who has been most consistent in clinging
throughout his life to these original principles of the Brotherhood. He
is distinguished by a depth of thought which at last tends to become
entirely elusive, and often a depth of spirit more profound than diver
ever plumbed; but at the same time by an angular, gnarled realism which
has scarcely its equal in all the European art of the century.

"The Flight of Madeleine and Porphyro," from Keats' _Eve of St. Agnes_,
was the first picture, the subject being borrowed in 1848 from his
favourite poet. In the work through which he first acknowledged himself
a member of the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood he has given a plain and
simple rendering of the scene in the introductory chapter of Bulwer
Lytton's _Rienzi_. He has chosen the moment when Rienzi, kneeling beside
the corpse of his brother, takes a vow of vengeance against the murderer
who is riding away. The composition avoids any kind of conventional
pyramidal structure. In the foreground every flower is painted and every
colour is frankly set beside its neighbour without the traditional
gradation. His third picture, "A Converted British Family sheltering a
Christian Missionary," is not to be reckoned amongst his best
performances. It is forced naïveté, suggesting the old masters, to unite
two entirely different scenes upon the same canvas: in the background
there are fugitives and pursuers, and a Druid, merely visible by his
outstretched arms, inciting the populace to the murder of a missionary;
in the foreground a hut open on all sides, which could really offer no
protection at all. Yet in this hut a priest is hiding, tended by
converted Britons. However, the drawing of the nude bodies is an
admirable piece of realism; admirable, also, is the way in which he has
expressed the fear of the inmates, and the fanatical bloodthirsty rage
of the pursuers, and this without any false heroics, without any
rhetoric based upon the traditional language of gesture. The picture
from Shakespeare's _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, with the motto, "Death is
a fearful thing, and shamed life a hateful," is perhaps theatrical in
its arrangement, though it is likewise earnest and convincing in
psychological expression.

Microscopic fidelity to nature, which formed the first principle in the
programme of the Brotherhood, has been carried in Holman Hunt to the
highest possible point. Every flower and every ear of corn, every
feather and every blade of grass, every fragment of bark on the trees
and every muscle, is painted with scrupulous accuracy. The joke made
about the pre-Raphaelites has reference to Holman Hunt: it was said that
when they had to paint a landscape they used to bring to their studio a
blade of grass, a leaf, and a piece of bark, and they multiplied them
microscopically so many thousand times until the landscape was finished.
His works are a triumph of industry, and for that very reason they are
not a pleasure to the eye. A petty, pedantic fidelity to nature injures
the total effect, and the hard colours--pungent green, vivid yellow,
glaring blue, and glowing red--which Holman Hunt places immediately
beside each other, give his pictures something brusque, barbaric, and
jarring. But as a reaction against a system of painting by routine,
which had become mannered, such truth without all compromise, such
painstaking effort at the utmost possible fidelity to nature, was, in
its very harshness, of epoch-making significance.

With regard, also, to the transcendental purport of his pictures Holman
Hunt is perhaps the most genuine of the group. In the whole history of
art there are no religious pictures in which uncompromising naturalism
has made so remarkable an alliance with a pietistic depth of ideas. The
first, which he sent to the exhibition of 1854, "The Light of the
World," represents Christ wandering through the night in a
gold-embroidered mantle, with a lantern in His hand, like a Divine
Diogenes seeking men. Taine, who studied the picture impartially without
the catalogue, describes it, without further addition, as "Christ by
night with a lantern." But for Holman Hunt the meaning is Christianity
illuminating the universe with the mystic light of Faith and seeking
admission at the long-closed door of unbelief. It was because of this
implicit suggestion that the work made an indescribable sensation in
England; it had to go on pilgrimage from town to town, and hundreds of
thousands of copies of the engraving were sold. The pietistic feeling
of this ascetic preacher was so strong that he was able to venture on
pictures like "The Scapegoat" of 1856 without becoming comical.

[Illustration: FORD MADOX BROWN.   CHRIST WASHING PETER'S FEET.]

A striving to attain the greatest possible local truth had led Holman
Hunt to the East when he began these biblical pictures. He spent several
years in Palestine studying the topographical character of the land, its
buildings and its people, and endeavoured with the help of these actual
men and women and these landscape scenes to reconstruct the events of
biblical history with antiquarian fidelity. To paint "The Shadow of
Death" he searched in the East until he discovered a Jew who
corresponded to his idea of Christ, and painted him, a strong, powerful
man, the genuine son of a carpenter, with that astounding truth to
nature with which Hubert van Eyck painted his Adam. Even the hairs of
the breast and legs are as faithfully rendered as if one saw the model
in a glass. Near this naked carpenter--for He is clothed only with a
leather apron--there kneels a modern Eastern woman, bowed over a chest,
in which various Oriental vessels are lying. The ground is covered with
shavings of wood. Up to this point, therefore, it is a naturalistic
picture from the modern East. But here Holman Hunt's pietistic sentiment
is seen: it is the eve of a festival; the sun casts its last dying rays
into the room; the journeyman carpenter wearily stretches out His arms,
and the shadow of His body describes upon the wall the prophetic form of
the Cross.

Another picture represented the discovery of our Lord in the Temple, a
third the flock which has been astray following the Good Shepherd into
His Father's fold. On his picture of the flight into Egypt, or, as he
has himself called it, "The Triumph of the Innocents," he published a
pamphlet of twelve pages, in which he goes into all the historical
events connected with the picture with the loyalty of an historian; he
discusses everything--in what month the flight took place, and by what
route, how old Christ was, to what race the ass belonged, and what
clothes were worn by Saint Joseph and Mary. One might be forgiven for
thinking such a production the absurd effusion of a whimsical pedant
were it not that Hunt is so grimly in earnest in everything he does. In
spite of all his peculiarities it must be admitted that he gave a deep
and earnest religious character to English art, which before his time
had been so paltry; and this explains the powerful impression which he
made upon his contemporaries.

The artist most closely allied to him in technique is _Ford Madox
Brown_, who did not reckon himself officially with the pre-Raphaelites,
though he followed the same principles in what concerned the treatment
of detail. Only a little senior to the founders of the Brotherhood--he
was nine-and-twenty at the time--he is to be regarded as their more
mature ally and forerunner. Rossetti was under no illusion when, in the
beginning of his studies, he turned to him directly. In those years
Madox Brown was the only English painter who was not addicted to the
trivialities of paltry _genre_ painting or the theatrical heroics of
traditional history. He is a bold artist, with a gift of dramatic force
and a very rare capacity of concentration, and these qualities hindered
him from following the doctrine of the pre-Raphaelites in all its
consequences. If he had, in accordance with their programme, exclusively
confined himself to work from the living model, several of his most
striking and powerful pictures would never have been painted.

  MILLAIS.   THE NORTH-WEST PASSAGE.]

Madox Brown passed his youth on the Continent--in Antwerp with Wappers,
in Paris, and in Rome. The pictures which he painted there in the
beginning of the forties were produced, as regards technique, under the
influence of Wappers. The subjects were taken from Byron: "The Sleep of
Parisina" and "Manfred on the Jungfrau." It is only in the latter that
an independent initiative is perceptible. In contradistinction from the
generalities of the school of Wappers he aimed at greater depth of
psychology and accuracy of costume, while at the same time he
endeavoured, though without success, to replace the conventional studio
light by the carefully observed effect of free light. These three
things--truth of colour, of spiritual expression, and of historical
character--were from this time forth his principal care. And when his
cartoon of "Harold," painted in Paris in the year 1844, was exhibited in
Westminster Hall, it was chiefly this scrupulous effort at truth which
made such a vivid impression upon the younger generation. In the first
masterpiece which he painted after his return to London in 1848 he
stands out already in all his rugged individuality. "Lear and Cordelia,"
founded on a most tragic passage in the most tragic of the great dramas
of Shakespeare, is here treated with impressive cogency. It stood in
such abrupt opposition to the traditional historical painting that
perhaps nothing was ever so sharply opposed to anything so universally
accepted. The figures stand out stiff and parti-coloured like card
kings, without fluency of line or rounded and generalised beauty. And
the colouring is just as incoherent. The brown sauce, which every one
had hitherto respected like a binding social law, had given way to a
bright joy of colour, the half-barbaric motley which one finds in old
miniatures. It is only when one studies the brilliant details, used
merely in the service of a great psychological effect, that this
outwardly repellent picture takes shape as a powerful work of art, a
work of profound human truth. Nothing is sacrificed to pose, graceful
show, or histrionic affectation. Like the German masters of the
fifteenth century, Madox Brown makes no attempt to dilute what is ugly,
nor did Holbein either when he painted the leprous beggars in his "Altar
to St. Sebastian." Every figure, whether fair or foul, is, in bearing,
expression, and gesture, a character of robust and rigorous hardihood,
and has that intense fulness of life which is compressed in those carved
wooden figures of mediæval altars: the aged Lear with his weather-beaten
face and his waving beard; the envious Regan; the cold, cruel, ambitious
Goneril; Albany, with his fair, inexpressive head; the gross, brutal
Cornwall; Burgundy, biting his nails in indecision; and Cordelia, in her
touching, bashful grace. And to this angular frankness of the primitive
masters he unites the profound learning of the modern historian. All the
archæological details, the old British costumes, jewels, modes of
wearing the hair, weapons, furniture, and hangings, have been studied
with the accuracy of Menzel. He knows nothing of the academic rules of
composition, and his robes fall naturally without the petty appendage of
fair folds and graceful motives.

[Illustration: MILLAIS.   THE HUGUENOT.]

The picture in which he treated the balcony scene in Shakespeare's
_Romeo and Juliet_ is outwardly repellent, like "Lear and Cordelia," but
what a hollow effect is made by Makart's theatrical heroics beside this
aboriginal sensuousness, this intensity of expression! Juliet's dress
has fallen from her shoulders, and, devoid of will and thought, with
closed lids, half-naked, and thrilling in every fibre with the lingering
joy of the hours that have passed, she abandons herself to the last
fiery embraces of Romeo, who in stormy haste is feeling with one foot
for the ladder of ropes.

He has solved a yet more difficult problem in the picture "Elijah and
the Widow."

[Illustration: _Brothers, photo._

  MILLAIS.   AUTUMN LEAVES.]

"See, thy son liveth," are the words in the Bible with which the hoary
Elijah brings the boy, raised from death and still enveloped in his
shroud, to the agonised mother kneeling at the foot of the sepulchre.
The woman makes answer: "Now by this I know that thou art a man of God."
In the embodiment of this scene likewise Madox Brown has aimed in
costume and accessories at a complete harmony between the figures and
the character of the epoch, and has set out with an entirely accurate
study of Assyrian and Egyptian monuments. Even the inscription on the
wall and the Egyptian antiquities correspond to ancient originals. At
the same time the figures have been given the breath of new life. Elijah
looks more like a wild aboriginal man than a saint of the Cinquecento.
The ecstasy of the mother, the astonishment of the child whose great
eyes, still unaccustomed to the light, gaze into the world again with a
dreamy effort, after having beheld the mysteries of death--these are
things depicted with an astonishing power. The downright but convincing
method in which Hogarth paints the soul has dislodged the hollow,
heroical ideal of beauty of the older historical painting. Madox Brown's
confession of faith, which he formulated as an author, culminates in the
tenet that truth is the means of art, its end being the quickening of
the soul. This he expresses in two words: "emotional truth."

While Holman Hunt and Madox Brown held fast throughout their lives to
the pre-Raphaelite principles, pre-Raphaelitism was for _John Everett
Millais_, the youngest of the three, merely a transitory phase, a stage
in his artistic development.

Sir John Millais was born 8th June 1829, in Southampton, where his
family had come from Jersey. Thus he is half a Frenchman by descent.
His childhood was passed in Dinant in Brittany, but when he was nine
years old he went to a London school of drawing. He was then the little
fair-haired boy in a holland blouse, a broad sash, and a large sailor's
collar, whom John Phillip painted in those days. When eleven he entered
the Royal Academy, probably being the youngest pupil there; at thirteen
he won a prize medal for the best drawing from the antique; at fifteen
he was already painting; and at seventeen he exhibited an historical
picture, "Pizarro seizing the Inca of Peru," which was praised by the
critics as the best in the exhibition of 1846. With "Elgiva," a work
exhibited in 1847, this first period, in which he followed the lines of
the now forgotten painter Hilton, was brought to an end. His next work,
"Lorenzo and Isabella," now in the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool, bore
the letters P.R.B., as a sign of his new confession of faith.
Microscopically exact work in detail has taken the place of the large
bravura and the empty imitation of the Cinquecentisti. The theme was
borrowed from one of Boccaccio's tales, _The Pot of Basil_--the tale on
which Keats founded _Isabella_. A company of Florentines in the costume
of the thirteenth century are assembled at dinner. Lorenzo, pale and in
suppressed excitement, sits beside the lovely Isabella, looking at her
with a glance of deep, consuming passion. Isabella's brother, angered at
it, gives a kick to her dog. All the persons at the table are
likenesses. The critic F. G. Stephens sat for the beloved of Isabella,
and Dante Gabriel Rossetti for the toper holding his glass to his lips
at the far right of the table. Even the ornaments upon the damask cloth,
the screen, and the tapestry in the background are painted, stroke after
stroke, with the conscientious devotion of a primitive painter. Jan van
Eyck's brilliancy of colour is united to Perugino's suavity of feeling,
and the chivalrous spirit of the _Decameron_ seized with the sureness of
a subtle literary scholar.

[Illustration: _L'Art._

  MILLAIS.   THE YEOMAN OF THE GUARD.]

The work of 1850, "The Child Jesus in the Workshop of Joseph the
Carpenter," illustrated a verse in the Bible (Zechariah xiii. 6): "And
one shall say unto Him, What are these wounds in Thine hands? Then He
shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of My
friends." The Child Jesus, who is standing before the joiner's bench,
has hurt Himself in the hand. St. Joseph is leaning over to look at the
wound, and Mary is kneeling beside the Child, trying to console Him
with her caresses, whilst the little St. John is bringing water in a
wooden vessel. Upon the other side of the bench stands the aged Anna, in
the act of drawing out of the wood the nail which has caused the injury.
A workman is labouring busily at the joiner's bench. The floor of the
workshop is littered with shavings, and tools hang round upon the walls.
The Quattrocentisti were likewise the determining influence in the
treatment of this subject. Ascetic austerity has taken the place of
ideal draperies, and angularity that of the noble flow of line. The
figure of Mary, who, with her yellow kerchief, resembled the wife of a
London citizen, was the cause of special offence.

Up to the seventies Millais continued to paint such pictures out of the
Bible, or from English and mediæval poets, with varying success. One of
them, which in its brilliant colouring looked like an old picture upon
glass, represented the return of the dove to Noah's ark. The central
point was formed by two slender young women in mediæval costume, who
received the exhausted bird in their delicate hands. The picture, "The
Woodman's Daughter," was an illustration to a poem by Coventry Patmore,
on the love of a young noble for a poor child of the wood. In a
semicircular picture of 1852 he painted Ophelia as she floats singing in
the green pool where the white water-lilies cover her like mortuary
wreaths--floats with her parted lips flickering with a gentle smile of
distraction. The other picture of this year, "The Huguenot," represented
two lovers taking leave of each other in an old park upon the eve of St.
Bartholomew. She is winding a white scarf round his arm to save him from
death by this badge of the Catholics, whilst he is gently resisting. The
mood of the man standing before the dark gate of death, the moral
strength which vanquishes his fear, and all the solemnity of his
farewell to life are expressed in his glance. A world of love rests in
the eyes of the woman. Millais has often treated this problem of the
loving woman with earnest and almost sombre realism, that knows no touch
of swooning sentimentality. "The Order of Release" of 1853 shows a
jailor in the scarlet uniform of the eighteenth century opening a heavy
prison door to set at liberty a Highlander, whose release has been
obtained by his wife. A scene from the seventeenth century is treated in
"The Proscribed Royalist": a noble cavalier, hidden in a hollow tree, is
kissing the hand of a graceful, trembling woman, who has been daily
bringing him food at the risk of her life. "The Black Brunswicker" of
1856 closed this series of silent and motionless dramas. In the picture
of 1857, "Sir Isumbras at the Ford," an old knight is riding home
through the twilight of a sultry day in June. The dust of the journey
lies upon his golden armour. At a ford he has fallen in with two
children, and has lifted them up to carry them over the water. And "The
Vale of Rest," a picture deep and intense in its scheme of colour,
earnest and melancholy as a requiem, revealed--with a sentiment a little
like that of Lessing--a cloister garden where two nuns are silently
preparing a grave in the evening light; while "The Eve of Saint Agnes"
in 1863 illustrated the same poem of Keats to which ten years previously
Holman Hunt had devoted his work of early years. Madeleine has heard the
old legend, telling how girls receive the tender homage of their future
husbands if they go through their evening prayer supperless at midnight.
With her heart filled with the thoughts of love she quits the hall where
the guests are seated at a merry feast, and mounts to her room so
hastily that her thin taper is extinguished on the way. She enters her
little chamber, kneels down, repeats the prayer, and rises to her feet,
taking off her finery and loosening her hair. The clear moonlight
streams through the window, throwing a ghostly illumination over the
little images of saints in the room, falling like a caress upon the
tender young breast of the girl, playing upon her folded hands, and
touching her long, fair hair with a radiance like a vaporous glory. In
the shadow of the bed she sees him whom she loves. Motionless, as in a
dream, she stands, nor ventures to turn lest the fair vision should
vanish. "The Deliverance of a Heretic condemned to the Stake," "Joan of
Arc," "Cinderella," "The Last Rose," that dreamy picture of romantic
grace, "The Childhood of Sir Walter Raleigh," and the picture of the
hoary Moses, supported by Hur and Aaron, watching from the mountain-top
the victory of Joshua, were the principal works achieved in the later
years of the master. But when these pictures were executed England had
become accustomed to honour Millais, not as a pre-Raphaelite, but as her
greatest portrait painter.

[Illustration: MILLAIS.   THOMAS CARLYLE.]

His portrait of himself explains this transformation. With his white
linen jacket and his fresh sunburnt face Sir John Millais does not look
in the least like a "Romanticist," scarcely like a painter; he has
rather the air of being a wealthy landowner. He was a man of a sound and
straightforward nature, a great and energetic master, conscious of his
aim, but a poet in Ruskin's sense of the word is what he has never been.
His pre-Raphaelitism was only a flirtation. His methods of thought were
too concrete, his hand too powerful, for him to have lingered always in
the world of the English poets, or endured the precise style of the
pre-Raphaelites. "Millais will 'go far' if he will only change his
boots," About had written on the occasion of the World Exhibition of
1855; when that of 1867 was opened Millais appeared in absolutely new
shoes. The great exhibition of 1857 in Manchester, which made known for
the first time how many of the works of Velasquez were hidden in English
private collections, had helped Millais to the knowledge of himself.
From the naturalism of the Quattrocentisti he made a transition to the
naturalism of Velasquez.

Millais was a born portrait painter. His cool and yet finely sensitive
nature, his simple, manly temperament, directed him to this department,
which rather gravitates to the observant and imitative than to the
creative pole of art. In his pictures he has the secret of enchanting
and of repelling; he has arrived at really definite issues in portrait
painting. His likenesses are all of them as convincing as they are
actual. Together with the Venetians and with Velasquez, Millais belongs
to the master spirits of the grand style, which relies upon the large
movement of lines, in figure and in face, upon the broad foundation of
surfaces, and the strict subordination of individual details. His
figures are characteristic and recognisable even in outline. He makes no
effort to render them interesting by picturesque attitudes, or to vivify
them by placing them in any situation. There they stand calm, and
sometimes stiff and cold; they make no attempt at conversation with the
spectator, nor come out of themselves, as it were, but fix their eyes
upon him with an air of well-bred composure and indifference. Even the
hands are not made use of for characterisation.

[Illustration: _Cassell & Co._

  MILLAIS.   THE VALE OF REST.]

The extraordinary intensity of life which sparkles in his great figures,
so simply displayed, is almost exclusively concentrated in the heads.
Millais is perhaps the first master of characterisation amongst the
moderns. To bold and powerful exposition there is united a noble and
psychical gaze. The eyes which he paints are like windows through which
the soul is visible.

[Illustration: _Mag. of Art._

  FORD MADOX BROWN.   THE LAST OF ENGLAND.]

Amongst his portraits of men, those of Gladstone and Hook stand in the
first rank: as paintings perhaps they are not specially eminent; both
have an opaque, sooty tone, from which Millais' works not unfrequently
suffer, but as a definition of complex personalities they are comparable
only with the best pictures of Lenbach. How firmly does the statesman
hold himself, despite his age, the old tree-feller, the stern idealist,
a genuine English figure chiselled out of hard wood. The play of light
centres all the interest on the fine, earnest, and puckered features,
the lofty forehead, the energetic chin, and the liquid, thoughtful eyes.
All the biography of Gladstone lies in this picture, which is simpler
and greater in intuition than that which Lenbach painted of him. Hook,
with his broad face, furrowed with wrinkles, looks like an apostle or a
fisher. Millais has looked into the heart of this man, who has in him
something rugged and faithful, massive and tender; the painter of
vigorous fishermen and vaporous sunbeams. Hook's landscapes have a
forceful, earnest, and well-nigh religious effect, and something
patriarchal and biblical lies in his gentle, reflective, and
contemplative glance.

In his portrait of the Duke of Westminster, painted in 1878, Millais
depicts him in hunting dress, red coat, white corduroys, and high,
flexible boots, as he stands and buttons on his glove. The same year
"The Yeoman of the Guard" was exhibited in Paris--the old type of
discipline and loyalty, who sits there in his deep red uniform, with
features cast in bronze, like a Velasquez of 1878. Disraeli, Cardinal
Newman, John Bright, Lord Salisbury, Charles Waring, Sir Henry Irving,
the Marquis of Lorne, and Simon Fraser are all worthy descendants of the
eminent men whom Reynolds painted a century before. The plastic effect
of the figures is increased by the vacant, neutral ground of the
picture. Like Velasquez, Millais has made use of every possible
background, from the simplest, from the nullity of an almost black or
bright surface, to richly furnished rooms and views of landscape.
Sometimes it is only indicated by a plain chair or table that the figure
is standing in a room, or a heavy crimson curtain falls to serve as a
_repoussoir_ for the head. With a noble abstention he avoids prettiness
of line and insipid motives, and remains true to this virile taste even
in his portraits of women. His women have curiously little of the
æsthetical trait which runs elsewhere through English portraits of
ladies. Millais renders them--as in the picture "Dummy Whist"--neither
sweet nor tender, gives them nothing arch, sprightly, nor triumphant.
Severe and sculptural in their mien, and full of character rather than
beauty, proud in bearing and upright in pose, their serious, energetic
features betray decision of character; and the glance of their brown
eyes--eyes like Juno's--is indifferent and almost hard. A straight and
liberal forehead, a beautifully formed and very determined mouth, and a
full, round chin complete this impression of earnest dignity, august
majesty, and chilling pride. To this regular avoidance of every trace of
available charm there is joined a strict taste in toilette. He prefers
to work with dark or subdued contrasts of colour, and he is also fond of
large-flowered silks--black with citron-yellow and black with dark red.

And this same stringent painter of character commands, as few others,
the soft light brush of a painter of children. No one since Reynolds and
Gainsborough has painted with so much character as Millais the dazzling
freshness of English youth; the energetic pose of a boy's head or the
beauty of an English girl--a thing which stands in the world alone: the
soft, glancing, silken locks, rippling to a _blonde cendrée_, pale,
delicate little faces, pouting little mouths, and great, shining blue,
dreamy, childish eyes. Sometimes they stand in rose-coloured dresses
embroidered with silver in front of a deep green curtain, or sit reading
upon a dark red carpet flowered with black. At other times they are
arrayed like the little Infantas of Velasquez, and play with a spaniel
like the Doge's children of Titian, or hold out with both hands an apron
full of flowers, which Millais paints with a high degree of finish. A
spray of pale red roses, chrysanthemums, or lilies stands near. One must
be a great master of characterisation to paint conscious, dignified, and
earnest feminine beauty like that of Mrs. Bischoffsheim, and at the same
time that fragrant perfume of the fresh and dewy spring of youth which
breathes from Millais' pictures of children.

[Illustration: PHILLIP.   THE LETTER-WRITER, SEVILLE.]

Millais is one of those men in the history of nineteenth-century
painting who are as forcible and healthy as they are many-sided. I do
not know one who could have developed so swiftly from a style of the
most minute exactness to one of the most powerful breadth; not one who
could have united such poetry of conception with such an enormous
knowledge of human beings; not one who could have been so like Proteus
in variety--at one moment charming, at another dreamy, at another
entirely positive. In their firm structure and largeness of manner his
landscapes sometimes recall Théodore Rousseau. And now the
pre-Raphaelite is just a little evident in an excess of detail. He
paints every blade of grass and every small plant, though there is at
the same time a largeness in the midst of this scrupulous exactitude. He
does not merely see the isolated fact through a magnifying lens, but has
eyes that are sensitive to the poetry of the whole, and in spite of all
study of detail he sometimes reaches a total effect which is altogether
impressionist. His picture "Chill October" has an airy life, a grey,
vibrating atmosphere, such as only John Constable painted elsewhere.

Such a concrete study of nature as was made by the pre-Raphaelites of
necessity led at last to entirely realistic pictures from modern life.
In their biblical and poetic pictures they had started from the
conviction that new life-blood could only be poured into the old
conventional types, which had gradually become meaningless by tactfully
drawing the models for them from popular life. They believed, as the
masters of Florence and Bruges had done before them, that there could be
no good painting without strict dependence on the model; that it was of
the utmost importance to give a poetic or legendary figure the stamp of
nature, the strong savour of individuality. All their creations are
based upon the elements of portrait painting, even when they illustrate
remote scenes from the New Testament or from mediæval poetry. And these
elements at last led them altogether to give up transposing such figures
into an alien _milieu_, and simply to paint what was offered by their
own surroundings. In this way they reached the goal which was arrived at
in French painting through Courbet and Ribot. It is due in the first
place to the pre-Raphaelites that the well-meant and moderately painted
_genre_ picture of the old style, which, with its wealth of pathetic
stories, was once a prime source of supposed artistic pleasure, was
finally vanquished in England, and made way for earnest and vigorous
painting,--painting which sought to make its effect by purely artistic
means, and proudly declined attempt to conceal intrinsic weakness in
"interesting" subject drawn from external sources. As early as 1855
Millais exhibited a picture in the Royal Academy which Ruskin called a
truly great work containing the elements of immortality--"The Rescue."
It represented a fireman who has carried three children from a burning
house and laid them in the arms of their parents. Narrative purport was
entirely renounced. The fireman was treated without sentimentality, and
in a way that suggested the cool fulfilment of a duty, and the agitation
of the parents was also rendered without any dash of melodrama. Then
there followed that masterpiece of exquisite and soft colouring, tender
and moving expression, and infinite grace, "The Gambler's Wife," sadly
taking up the cards which have brought her misery upon her. In 1874 was
painted "The North-West Passage," a sort of modern symbol of the
forceful, enterprising English people who have populated and subdued
half the world from their little island kingdom. "There is a passage to
the Pole, and England will find it--must find it." These are more or
less the words spoken by Trelawney, the old friend and comrade of Byron
in Greece. With a chart before him he is brooding over the plan of the
North-West Passage, and upon his own outstretched hand, which would fain
hold the future in its grasp, the hand of a youthful woman is soothingly
laid, as she sits at his feet reading to him the narrative of the last
voyage of discovery. The figure of the seaman with his white beard has
a strong, sinewy life, and the broad daylight streams through the room,
filled with charts and atlases. The sea and clear, bright sky gleam
through the open window. It is a powerful and moving picture, one of
those modern creations in which the ideas of the nineteenth century are
concentrated with simplicity and a renunciation of all hollow emphasis.

[Illustration: PHILLIP.   SPANISH SISTERS.]

A few pictures of modern life which have nothing in common with the
older _genre_ painting may even be found among the works of the
devotionalist Holman Hunt. "Awakened Conscience," according to the
explanation of the painter, tells the story of a young woman seduced by
a cruel and light-minded man, and kept in a luxurious little
country-house. They are together. Seated at the piano he is playing the
old melody "Oft in the Stilly Night," and the strains of the song recall
to the frail maiden her youth, and the years of purity and innocence.
Thus even Hunt has not overcome the moralising tendencies of Hogarth,
though his taste is more discreet and delicate. He has struck deeper
chords of thought than the English public had heard before. And in
particular the painting is not a mere substratum for the story; it has
become the principal thing, and the story subsidiary. In another
picture, "May Morning on Magdalen Tower," he renounced all deeper
purpose altogether, and merely painted a number of Oxford dons and
students, who, in accordance with the old custom, usher in the May with
a hymn from the college tower.

But the most remarkable work of this description has been executed by
Madox Brown, the English Menzel, who has not merely reconstructed the
environment of past ages with the accuracy of an eye-witness, but has
looked upon the drama of modern life as an attentive observer. His first
picture, "The Last of England," was executed in the June of 1852, at a
time when emigration to America began to take serious proportions. A
married couple, humble, middle-class people, are sitting on the deck of
a ship. The man, in his thick cloth overcoat, with a soft felt hat on
his head, a pale face, and sunken eyes with dark rings underneath, casts
one more look upon his native-land, which vanishes in the hazy distance,
as he thinks bitterly of lost hopes and vain struggles. But the young
wife, in a light-coloured cloak and a pretty round bonnet with wide
strings, gazes before her with gentle resignation, from underneath a
great umbrella protecting her from the boisterous sea-wind.

In "Work," begun at the same period, and finished, after various
interruptions, in 1865, he has produced the first modern picture of
artisans after Courbet's "Stone-breakers." The painter, who was then
living in Hampstead, where extensive cuttings were being made for the
laying down of gas-pipes, daily saw the English artisan at labour in all
his thick-set strength. This gave him the theme for his picture. In
bright daylight on a glaring summer afternoon artisans are digging a
trench for gas-pipes in a busy street. Women and poor children are
standing near. Even the older _genre_ artists had painted men in their
working blouses, but only joking and making merry, never at work. Like
stage-managers who are sure of their public, they always set the same
troop of puppets dancing. Madox Brown's artisans are robust and
raw-boned figures; where the older artists affected to be witty with
their _genre_ painting, Madox Brown painted straightforwardly, without
humour and without making his figures beautiful. The composition of his
pictures is just as plain. No one poses, no one makes impassioned
gestures, no one thinks of grouping himself with his neighbour in fine
flowing lines. It is pleasant to think that this powerful symbol of work
has passed by presentation into the possession of one of the greatest
manufacturing towns in England, into the gallery of Manchester.

[Illustration: R. ANSDELL.   A SETTER AND GROUSE.]

A Scotchman, born in Aberdeen, _John Phillip_ was the vigorous abettor
of the pre-Raphaelites in these realistic endeavours. He, too, was a
painter in the full meaning of the word, and he has therefore left works
with which the future will have to reckon. Velasquez had opened his eyes
as he had opened those of Millais. When Phillip went to Spain in 1851,
he was not the first who had trod the Museo del Prado. Wilkie had
painted in Spain before him, and Ansdell had been busy there at the same
time. But no one had been able to grasp in any degree the impressive
majesty of the old Spanish painters. John Phillip alone gained something
of the _verve_ of Velasquez, a broad, virile technique which
distinguishes him from all his English contemporaries. The impression
received from his pictures is one of opulence, depth, and weight; they
unite something of the strength of Velasquez to a more Venetian
splendour of colour. The streets of Seville, the Spanish port on the
Guadalquivir, the town where Velasquez and Murillo were born, were his
chief field of study. Here he saw those market-women, black as mulattoes
and sturdy as grenadiers, who sit in front of their fruit-baskets under
a great umbrella, and those water-carriers with sunburnt visages,
strongly built chests, and athletic arms.

After he had returned to Scotland he occasionally painted pictures of
ceremonies, "The House of Commons," "The Wedding of the Princess
Royal," and so forth, but he soon returned to subjects from Spanish
life. Gipsy-looking, cigarette-smoking women, with sparkling eyes and
jet-black hair, young folks dancing to the castanets, bull-fighters with
glittering silver-grey costume and flashing glances, dark-brown peasants
in citron-yellow petticoats, hollow-eyed manufactory girls, potters, and
glass-blowers.--such are the materials of Phillip's pictures. They give
no scope to anecdote; but they always reveal a fragment of reality which
emits a world of impressions and an opulence of artistic ability. As
painter _par excellence_, John Phillip stands in opposition to older
English _genre_ painters. Whilst they were, in the first place, at pains
to tell a story intelligibly, Phillip was a colourist, a _maître
peintre_, whose figures were developed from the colours, and whose
creations are so full of character that they will always assert their
place with the best that has ever been painted. Even in England, the
country of literary and narrative painting, art was no longer an
instrument for expressing ideas; it had become an end in itself, and had
discovered colour as its prime and most essential medium of expression.




CHAPTER XXIX

REALISM IN GERMANY


In Germany the realistic movement was carried out in much the same way
as in France, though it came into action two decades after its French
original. Here also it was recognised that the well-meant but badly
painted anecdote must give way to the well-painted picture: and if we
inquire who it was that gave to Germany the first serious paintings
inspired by the modern spirit the reply, without hesitation, must be
Adolf Menzel. The pioneering work of this great little man, who for
fifty years had embodied in their typical perfection all phases of
German art, is something fabulous: the greatest and, one might almost
say, the only historical painter of bygone epochs, the only one who knew
a previous period so intimately that he could venture on painting it,
was also the leader of the great movement which, in the seventies, aimed
at the representation of our own life. His first appearance was in the
time when the proud Titan Cornelius sought to take heaven by storm.
Little Menzel was no Titan in those days; he seems in that generation
like one bound to the earth, yet he belonged to the Cyclopean race. He
was a mighty architect with the powers of a giant; and this uncouth
Cyclops rough-hewed and chiselled the blocks, and, fitting each in its
place, raised an edifice to as lofty a height as the Romanticists had
reached on the perilous wings of Icarus. Having been first the
draughtsman and then the painter of Frederick the Great, he gave up
history after finishing the picture of the Battle of Hochkirch: his
talent was too modern, too much set upon what was concrete, to admit of
its being given full scope to the end by constructive work from a
_milieu_ that was not his own. Until his fortieth year he had celebrated
the glorious past of his country. When, with the death of Friedrich
Wilhelm IV, a great and decisive turn was given to the politics of the
Prussian state--one which put an end to the stagnation of civil life in
Prussia and Germany, and ushered in a new and brilliant period for the
realm and the heirs of Friedrich--the painter of Friedrich the Great
became the painter of the new realm. After he had already, in the first
half of the century, placed reality on the throne of art in the place of
rhetoric and a vague ideal, he went one step further in the direction of
keen and direct observation, and now painted what he saw around him--the
stream of palpitating life.

"The Coronation of King Wilhelm at Königsberg" is the great and
triumphant title-page to this section of his art. The effects of light,
the red tones of the uniforms, the shimmering white silk dresses, the
surging of the mass of people, the perfect ease with which all the
personages are individualised, the princes, the ministers, the
ambassadors, the men of learning, the instantaneousness in the movement
of the figures, the absolutely unforced and yet subtle and pictorial
composition, render this painting no picture of ceremonies, in the
traditional sense of the phrase, but a work of art at once intimate and
august in the impression which it makes. In the picture "King Wilhelm
setting out to join the Army"--the representation of the thrilling
moment, on the afternoon of 31st July 1870, when the King drove along
the linden avenue to the railway station--this phase, which he began
with the Coronation picture, was brought to a close. Everything surges
and moves, speaks and breathes, and glows with the palpitating life
which vibrates through all in this moment of patriotic excitement. But
the painter's course led him further.

[Illustration: ADOLF MENZEL.]

He first became entirely Menzel when he made the discovery of toiling
humanity. In 1867, in the year of the World Exhibition, he came to Paris
and became acquainted with Meissonier and Stevens. With Meissonier in
particular--whose portrait he painted--he entered into a close
friendship, and it was curious afterwards to see the two together at
exhibitions--the little figure of Menzel with his gigantic bald forehead
and the little figure of Meissonier with his gigantic beard, a Cyclops
and a Gnome, two kings in the realm of Liliput, of whom one was unable
to speak a word of German and the other unable to speak a word of
French, although they had need merely of a look, a shrug, or a movement
of the hand to understand each other entirely. He also came into the
society of Courbet, who had just made the famous separate exhibition of
his works, at the Café Lamartine, in the company of Heilbuth, Meyerheim,
Knaus, and others. Here in Paris he produced his first pictures of
popular contemporary life, and if as an historical painter he had
already been a leader in the struggle against theatrical art, he became
a pioneer in these works also. Everywhere he let in air and made free
movement possible for those who pressed forward in his steps. In the
course of years he painted and drew everything which excited in him
artistic impulse upon any ground whatever, and not one of these
endeavours was work thrown away. A universal genius amongst the painters
of real life, he combined all the qualities of which other men of
excellent talent merely possessed fragments separately apportioned
amongst them: the sharpest eye for every detail of form, the most
penetrative discrimination for the life of the spirit, and at times a
glistening play of colour possessed by none of his German predecessors.

Catholic churches seem always to have had a great attraction for him, as
well as the people moving in them, and in this an echo of his _rococo_
enthusiasm is still perceptible. The quaint, _rococo_ churches in the
ornate style favoured by the Jesuits, which are still preserved intact
in Munich and the Tyrol, were those for which he had a peculiar
preference. He lost himself voluptuously in the thousand details of
sculpture, framework, organs, balustrades, and carved pulpits, dimly
outlined in the subdued light from stained-glass windows. In the gloom
it was all transformed into a forest of ornaments, expanding their
traceries like trees in a wood. Sick and infirm people, women in prayer
burying their faces in their hands, and lame men with crutches, kneel or
move amid the luxuriant efflorescence of stone and wood and gold, of
angels' heads and shrines, garlands of flowers, consoles, and fonts of
holy water. Twisted marble pillars, church banners, lamps and lustres
mount in a confusion of capricious outlines at once tasteful and piquant
to the vaulted dome, where the painted skies, blackened by the
ascending mist of incense, seem waywardly fantastic.

After the churches the salons appealed to him. There came his pictures
of modern society: ladies and cavaliers of the Court upon ballroom
balconies, the conversation of Privy Councillors in the salon, the
marvellous ball supper, where a mass of beautiful shoulders, splendid
uniforms, and rustling silken trains move amid mirrors, lustres,
colonnades, and gilded frames. "The Ball Supper" of 1870 is a vivid
picture, bathed in glistening light. The music has stopped. And from a
door of the brilliantly lighted ballroom the company is streaming into
the neighbouring apartment, where the supper-table has been laid, and
groups of ladies and men in animated conversation are beginning to
occupy the chairs and sofas. In 1879 there followed the famous "Levee":
the Emperor Wilhelm in the red Court uniform of the _Gardes du Corps_ is
talking with a lady, surrounded by a sea of heads, uniforms, and naked
bowing shoulders. Though it was always necessary in earlier
representations of the kind to have a _genre_ episode to compensate the
insufficient artistic interest of the work, in Menzel's pictures the
pictorial situation is grasped as a whole. They have the value of a
book; they neither falsify nor beautify anything, and they will hand
down to the future an encyclopædia of types of the nineteenth century.

From the salon he went to the street, from exclusive aristocratic
circles into the midst of the eddying crowd. For many years in
succession Menzel was a constant visitor at the small watering-places in
the Austrian and Bavarian Alps. The multitude of people at the concerts,
in the garden of the restaurant, on the promenade, at the open-air
services, were precisely the things to occupy his brush. The light
rippled through the leaves of the trees; women, children, and well-bred
men of the world listened to the music or the words of the preacher. One
person leaves a seat and another takes it; everything lives and moves.
Huge and lofty trees stretch out their arms, protecting the company from
the sun. Unusually striking was "The Procession in Gastein": in the
centre was the priest bearing the Host, then the choristers in their red
robes, in front the visitors and tourists who had hastened to see the
spectacle, and in the background the mountain heights. The bustle of
people gives Menzel the opportunity for a triumph. In Kissingen he
painted the promenade at the waters; in Paris the Sunday gaiety in the
garden of the Tuileries, the street life upon the boulevard, the famous
scene in the _Jardin des Plantes_, with the great elephants and the
vivid group of Zouaves and ladies; in Verona the Piazza d'Erbe, with the
swarm of people crowding in between the open booths and shouting at the
top of their voices. Many after him have represented such scenes,
although few have had the secret of giving their figures such seething
life, or painting them, like Menzel, as parts of one great, surging, and
many-headed multitude.

  MENZEL.   THE CORONATION OF KING WILHELM I.]

People travelling have always been for him a source of much amusement:
men sitting in the corner of a railway carriage with their legs crossed
and their hats over their eyes, yawning or asleep; women looking out of
the windows or counting their ready money. Alternating with such themes
are those monotonous yet simple and therefore genial landscapes from the
suburbs of the great city, poor, neglected regions with machines and men
at their labour. Children bathing in a dirty stream bordered by little,
stunted willows; small craft gliding over a river, sailors leaping from
one vessel to another, men landing sacks or barrels, and great, heavy
cart-horses dragging huge waggons loaded with beer-barrels along the
dusty country road. Or the scaffolding of a house is being raised. Six
masons are at work upon it, and they are working in earnest. A green
bush waves (German fashion) above the scaffolding, and further off long
rows of houses stretch away, and the aqueducts and gas-works which
supply the huge crater of Berlin, and day-labourers are seen wheeling up
barrow-loads of stones. For the first time a German painter sings the
canticle of labour.

[Illustration: MENZEL.   FROM KUGLER'S "HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH THE GREAT."]

From the streets he enters the work-places, and interprets the wild
poetry of roaring machines in smoky manufactories. The masterpiece of
this group is that bold and powerful picture, his "Iron Mill" of 1876.
The workshop of the great rail-forge of Königshütte in Upper Silesia is
full of heat and steam. The muscular, brawny figures of men with glowing
faces stand at the furnace holding the tongs in their swollen hands.
Their vigorous gestures recall Daumier. Upon the upper part of their
bodies, which is naked, the light casts white, blue, and dark red
reflections, and over the lower part it flickers in reddish, greenish,
and violet tinges, on the creases in their clothing. The smoke rising in
spirals is of a whitish-red, and the beams supporting the roof are lit
up with a sombre glow. Heat, sweat, movement, and the glare of fire are
everywhere. Dust and dirt, strong, raw-boned iron-workers washing
themselves, or exhausted with hard toil, snatching a hasty meal, a
confusion of belting and machinery, no pretty anecdote but sober
earnest, no story but pure painting--these were the great and decisive
achievements of this picture. Courbet's "Stone-breakers" of 1851, Madox
Brown's "Work" of 1852, and Menzel's "Iron Mill" are the standard works
in the art of the nineteenth century.

  MENZEL.   THE DAMENSTIFTSKIRCHE AT MUNICH.]

Within German art Menzel has won an _enclave_ for himself, a rock amid
the sea. In France during the sixties he represented German art in
general. France offered him celebrity, and after this recognition he had
the fortune to be honoured in his native-land before he was overtaken by
old age. His realism was permitted to him at a time when realistic aims
were elsewhere reckoned altogether as æsthetic errors. This explains the
remarkable fact that Menzel's toil of fifty years had scarcely any
influence on the development of German painting; it would scarcely be
different from what it is now if he had never existed. When he might
have been an exemplar there was no one who dared to follow him. And
later, when German art as a whole had entered upon naturalistic lines,
the differences between him and the younger generation were more
numerous than their points of sympathy, so that it was impossible for
him to have a formative influence. He stood out in the new period merely
as a power commanding respect, like a hero of ancient times. Even the
isolated realistic onsets made in Berlin in the seventies are in no way
to be connected with him.

  MENZEL.   KING WILHELM SETTING OUT TO JOIN THE ARMY.]

If realism consisted in the dry and sober illustration of selected
fragments of reality, if upright feeling, loyalty, and honest patriotism
were serviceable qualities in art, a lengthier consideration should
certainly be accorded to _Anton von Werner_. In his _genre_ pictures of
campaign life everything is spick and span, everything is in its right
place and in soldierly order: it is all typically Prussian art. His
portraits are casino pictures, and as such it is impossible to imagine
how they could better serve their purpose. From the spurs to the
cuirassier helmet everything is correct and in accordance with military
regulation; even the likeness has something officially prescribed which
would make any recruit form front if suddenly brought face to face with
such a person. In his pictures of ceremonies his ability was just
sufficient to chronicle the function in question with the
conscientiousness of a clerk in a law court. The intellectual capacity
for seeing more of a great man than his immaculately polished boots and
the immaculately burnished buttons of his uniform was denied him, as was
the artistic capacity of exalting a picture-sheet to the level of a
picture.

Equipped with a healthy though trivial feeling for reality, _Carl
Güssow_ ventured to approach nature in a sturdy and robust fashion in
some of his works, and exhibited in Berlin a few life-sized figures,
"Pussy," "A Lover of Flowers," "Lost Happiness," "Welcome," "The Oyster
Girl," and so forth. Through these he opened for a brief period in
Berlin the era of yellow kerchiefs and black finger-nails, and on the
strength of them was exalted by the critics as a pioneer of realism or
else anathematised, according to their æsthetic creed. He had a robust
method of painting muscles and flesh and clothes of many colours, and of
setting green beside red and red beside yellow, yet even in these first
works--his only works of artistic merit--he never got beyond the banal
and barbaric transcript of a reality which was entirely without
interest.

_Max Michael_ seems to be somewhat influenced by Bonvin. Like the
latter, he was attracted by the silent motions of nuns, juicy
vegetables, dark-brown wainscoting, and the subdued light of interiors.
He was, like Ribot in France, although with less artistic power, a good
representative of that "school of cellar skylights" which imitated in a
sound manner the tone of the old Spanish masters. One of his finest
pictures, which hangs in the Kunsthalle in Hamburg, represents a girls'
school in Italy. A nun is presiding over the sewing-lesson; the
background is brown; the light comes through the yellow glass of a high
and small window (like that of an attic), and throws a brown dusky tone
over the room, in which the gay costumes of the little Italian girls,
with their white kerchiefs, make exceedingly pretty and harmonious spots
of colour. No adventure is hinted at, no episode related, but the
picturesque appearance of the little girls, and their tones in the
space, are all the more delicately rendered. A refined scheme of colour
recalling the old masters compensates for the want of incident.

  MENZEL.   SUNDAY IN THE TUILERIES GARDENS.]

In Vienna _August von Pettenkofen_ made a transition from the ossified,
antediluvian _genre_ painting to painting which was artistically
delicate. While the successors of Gauermann and Danhauser indulged in
heart-breaking scenes or humorous episodes, Pettenkofen was the first to
observe the world from a purely pictorial point of view. Alfred Stevens
had opened his eyes in Paris in 1851. Troyon's pictures and Millet's
confirmed him in his efforts. He was brought up on a property belonging
to his father in Galicia, and had been a cavalry officer before he
turned to painting: horses, peasants, and oxen are the simple figures of
his pictures. In the place of episodic, ill-painted stories he set the
meagre plains of lonely Pusta, sooty forges, gloomy cobblers' work
shops, dirty courtyards with middens and rubbish-heaps, gipsy
encampments, and desolate garrets. There is no pandering to
sentimentality or the curiosity excited by _genre_ painting. There are
delicate chords of colour, and that is enough. The artist was in the
habit of spending the summer months in the little town of Spolnok on the
Theiss, to the east of Pesth. Here he wandered about amongst the little
whitewashed houses, the booths of general dealers, and the
fruit-sellers' stalls. A lazily moving yoke of oxen with a lad asleep,
dark-eyed girls fetching water, poor children playing on the ground, old
men dreaming in the sun in a courtyard, are generally the only breathing
beings in his pictures. Here is a sandy village-square with low,
white-washed houses; there is a wain with oxen standing in the street,
or a postilion trotting away on his tired nag. Like Menzel, Pettenkofen
paints busy humanity absorbed in their toil, simple beings who do not
dream of leaving off work for the sake of those who frequent picture
galleries. What differentiates him from the Berlin painter is a more
lyrical impulse, something tender, thoughtful, and contemplative. Menzel
gives dramatic point to everything he touches; he sets masses in
movement, depicts a busy, noisy crowd, pressing together and elbowing
one another, forcing their way at the doors of theatres or the windows
of cafés in a multifarious throng. Pettenkofen lingers with the petty
artisan and the solitary sempstress. In Menzel's "Iron Mill" the sparks
are flying and the machines whirring, but everything is peaceful and
quiet in the cobblers' workshops and the sunny attics visited by
Pettenkofen. Menzel delights in momentary impressions and quivering
life; Pettenkofen in rest and solitude. In the former every one is
thinking and talking and on the alert; in the latter every one is
yawning or asleep. If Menzel paints a waggon, the driver cracks his whip
and one hears the team rattling over the uneven pavement; in Pettenkofen
the waggon stands quietly in a narrow lane, the driver enjoys a midday
rest, and an enervating, sultry heat broods overhead. Menzel has a love
for men and women with excitement written on their faces; Pettenkofen
avoids painting character, contenting himself with the reproduction of
simple actions at picturesque moments. The Berlin artist is
epigrammatically sharp; the Viennese is elegiac and melancholy. Menzel's
pictures have the changing glitter of rockets; those of Pettenkofen are
harmonised in the tone of a refined amateur. They have only one thing in
common: neither has found disciples; they are not culminating peaks in
Berlin or Vienna art so much as boulders wedged into another system.

  MENZEL.   A LEVEE.]

Whilst the realistic movement in both towns was confined to particular
masters, Munich had once again the mission of becoming a guiding
influence. Here all the tendencies of modern art have left the most
distinct traces, all movements were consummated with most consistency.
The heroes of Piloty followed the divinities of Cornelius, and these
were in turn succeeded by the Tyrolese peasants of Defregger, and amid
all this difference of theme one bond connected these works: for
interesting subject was the matter of chief importance in them, and the
purely pictorial element was something subordinate. The efforts of the
seventies had for their object the victory of this pictorial element. It
was recognised that the talent for making humorous points and telling
stories, which came in question as the determining quality in the
pictures of monks and peasants of the school of Defregger and Grützner,
was the expression of no real faculty for formative art--that it was
merely technical incompleteness complacently supported by the lack of
artistic sensibility in the public which had produced this narrative
painting. It was felt that the task of formative art did not consist in
narrative, but in representation, and in representation through the most
sensuous and convincing means which stood at its disposal. A renewed
study of the old masters made this recognition possible.
